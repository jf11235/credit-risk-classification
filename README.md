**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?

**Answer:** Based on the provided metrics, the logistic regression model fitted with oversampled data performs well in predicting both the "0" (healthy loan) and "1" (high-risk loan) labels. 

For the "0" (healthy loan) class:

Precision: The precision is 1.00, indicating that all instances predicted as "0" are correctly classified as healthy loans.

Recall: The recall is 0.99, suggesting that the model identifies 99% of the actual healthy loans.

F1-score: The F1-score is 1.00, indicating a perfect balance between precision and recall for the healthy loan class.

For the "1" (high-risk loan) class:

Precision: The precision is 0.84, which means that 84% of the instances predicted as high-risk loans are correctly classified.

Recall: The recall is 0.99, indicating that the model identifies 99% of the actual high-risk loans.

The F1-score is 0.91, reflecting a slightly lower balance between precision and recall compared to the healthy loan class.
